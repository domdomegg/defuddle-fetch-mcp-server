# defuddle-fetch-mcp-server

A Model Context Protocol server that provides web content fetching capabilities using the [Defuddle](https://github.com/kepano/defuddle) library. This server enables LLMs to retrieve and process content from web pages, automatically cleaning up the HTML and converting it to clean, readable markdown.

This is a drop-in replacement for the [default fetch MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) that uses [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability). This generally provides better results for most modern webpages.

## Features

- **Better Content Extraction**: Uses Defuddle to remove webpage clutter and extract main content: while keeping things like the page title and key metadata
- **Flexible Output**: Supports both markdown and raw HTML output
- **Chunked Reading**: Supports pagination with `start_index` and `max_length` parameters
- **Rich Metadata**: Extracts title, author, publication date, word count, and more

## Installation

To use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "defuddle-fetch": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "defuddle-fetch-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
